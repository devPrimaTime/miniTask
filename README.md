# Mean value
The goal is to calculate mean and weighted mean value of all nodes in tree with unlimited depth.:
- ![Graphical](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1601810949-76844.png)
- **Mean value** of tree above is (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11)/11 = 6
- **Weighted mean value** - is reduced by 10% for each depth reduction. E.g.
  -  (1+ (2+3+4)*0.9  + (5+6+7+8+9+10+11) *0.9*0.9 ) / 11 = 4,950909091
